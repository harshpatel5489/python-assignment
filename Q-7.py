# 7) How memory is managed in Python? 

"""
in python memory managment is a automatically,which make it easier for developer.
you dont need to manually manage a memory like in some other programming launguage (c,c++)

How Python Manages Memory:

1. Automatic memory allocation : 
when you are creating variable and object that time python automatically reserved a memory for it:

ex = 

a = 5

2 . garbage collection :

python has a built in garbage collector. this mean is automatically remove object or variable unused memory
 to free up space

ex = 
x = 10   # Memory is allocated to store the value 10
x = 20   # Memory for 10 is freed, and new memory is allocated for 20

3. Reference Counting: Python keeps track of how many references (or links) there are to an object.\
When there are no references to an object anymore, itâ€™s automatically cleaned up by the garbage collector.

a = [1, 2, 3]   # List object is created and memory is allocated
b = a           # Now, 'a' and 'b' both reference the same list
del a           # 'a' no longer references the list, but 'b' still does
